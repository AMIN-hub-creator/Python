Project Description:
Welcome to the world of automobiles! This project delves into the intricacies of an extensive Automobile Dataset, conducting a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unearth valuable insights. From handling missing data to visualizing trends and relationships, this EDA project provides a holistic view of the dataset.

Key Steps:
Data Loading and Cleaning:

Importing essential libraries for numerical functions, data preprocessing, and visualization.
Replacing "?" with NaN for missing data.
Imputing missing values for various columns using means and modes.
Univariate Analysis:

Visualizing the distribution of variables such as 'make,' 'symboling,' and 'normalized-losses.'
Generating histograms and bar plots to understand the frequency and patterns within the dataset.
Bivariate Analysis:

Exploring relationships between variables, such as 'make' and 'price,' 'drive-wheels' and 'price.'
Creating boxplots to identify price variations among different car makes and drive-wheel types.
Correlation Analysis:

Calculating and visualizing the correlation matrix to identify relationships between numerical variables.
Heatmap representation for a clearer understanding of variable correlations.
Distribution Analysis:

Investigating the distribution of car prices and other key features.
Assessing skewness and kurtosis to understand the shape of the distributions.
Scatter Plots:

Building scatter plots to analyze relationships, such as 'price' vs 'engine-size' and 'price' vs 'highway-mpg.'
Bar Charts:

Utilizing bar charts to compare city and highway MPG based on drive wheels.
Insights on Normalized Losses:

Examining normalized losses based on body style and the number of doors.
Findings:
Uncovering trends in car makes and their respective prices.
Identifying factors influencing car prices, including drive wheels and body styles.
Analyzing correlations between different numerical attributes.
Visualizing distributions and skewness for key features.
Providing valuable insights into the dataset for further exploration.
This EDA project serves as a foundation for understanding the Automobile Dataset, making it a valuable resource for enthusiasts, analysts, and data scientists. Explore the nuances of the automotive world through data!
